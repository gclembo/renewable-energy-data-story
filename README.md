# This project can be viewed as a webpage here: https://gclembo.github.io/renewable-energy-data-story/data_story

For this project I found data from a variety of sources and utilized the r programming language and the tidyverse packages to manipulate and explore these data. I also used ggplot2 package to create visualizations and express my findings. For the webpage I used basic HTML and CSS to create a medium that would make my plots and findings easily accessible.
